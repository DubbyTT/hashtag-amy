        <h1>A Bot Named Amy</h1>

<p>This bot runs on <a href="http://nodejs.org/">node.js</a>, usings Alain Gilbert's <a href="https://github.com/alaingilbert/Turntable-API">ttapi library</a>.<br>
It is currently in Development.</p>

<h3>Everything Is Done, but Queue is buggy.</h3>

<h3>Note if you know what you're doing :D</h3>

<p>While it makes sense to run <code>node main.js</code>
we aren't normal, so you'll ahve to run <code>node config.js</code></p>

<h1>Setup Instructions</h1>

<p>First things first: This is a guide, not a promise. I will not be able to help you set it up on your respective machine. With this guide, and 
the help of google, you should be able to manage it yourself. I do aplogize if this is an inconvenience for anyone.</p>

<h2>Step 1: Getting Dependencies</h2>

<p>This bot uses Node.JS. You're going to need that in order to be able to do anything. Got to the <a href="http://www.nodejs.org/">node website</a> and download
the latest version.</p>

<p>This bot also uses mongodb. This is a lightweight method of storing information. We have tried to make it toggleable as much as possible, but for the moment, a key feature still relies on it, so you'll need that too. You get it from <a href="http://www.mongodb.org/downloads">the mongodb site</a>.</p>

<h2>Step 2: Download ze bot</h2>

<p>Next, you'll need a copy of the bot. <a href="https://github.com/yayramen/hashtag-amy/zipball/master">Download the zip</a> and unzip it. Put the files someplace significant. For me, I put them in my home directory. </p>

<h2>Step 3: Installing More Dependencies!</h2>

<p>hashtag-amy requires node modules to work properly. So you'll need to grab a copy of npm. Google is your friend :D</p>

<p>Now the bot pretty much requires a terminal window. In OSX, it's Terminal.app. In Windows, go to Start -&gt; Run -&gt; and enter 'cmd'. In Linux, if you don't know, then you shouldn't be using linux, but you can just do Ctr-Alt-T.</p>

<p>Now cd into your directory. For me it's cd ~/hashtag-amy and run these commands:</p>

<pre><code>npm install ttapi
npm install underscore
npm install mongoskin
</code></pre>

<p>And hopefully I haven't forgotten one. If, later on, when you try to run the bot, you get an error saying 'can't find module blahblah'
just type in npm install blahblah</p>

<h2>Step 4: MongoDB</h2>

<p>If you want the bot to work, you'll need mongodb. Google how to install it. Once you install it, I can give you a bit of help where linux is concerned.
In terminal/bash/cmd whatever, type "mongo databasename" - where databasename is the name you want your database to be.
Then type db.addUser("username", "password"). 
If you come up with an error, google it. If not, you're good to go.
In the config.js, fill out the information like this:</p>

<pre><code>global.mMongoHost               = "localhost"; // or 127.0.0.1
global.mMongoDatabase           = "databasename";
global.mMongoUser               = "username";   
global.mMongoPass               = "password"
</code></pre>

<h2>Step 5: The Config File</h2>

<p>Now it's type fill everyting out. Open config.js using your preferred file editor [I use Sublime Text 2 on Ubuntu, but I code a lot].</p>

<p>The config is written in javascript,so remember that you can break things by deleting things so don't :D.
Note: If it's not true/false/null or a number, it requires quotes "". </p>

<p>You can view what most of them do <a href="http://billing.yayramen.com/index.php/kb/documentation/turntable-fm-bot-config-documentation">here</a></p>

<h2>Step 6: Running it.</h2>

<p>Open up a terminal/command prompt, cd to where you put the files and type</p>

<pre><code>node config.js
</code></pre>

<p>If you did it right, you'll see #Amy load up. Once it says "Joined the room, booted up!" the bot should be in your room!</p>
