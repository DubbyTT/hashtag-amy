Ideally, I'd like to run config.js rather than main.js - Dalton

Things I've done:
renamed amy.js to config.js (why the change to begin with? trying for ambiguity :P)
Changed log from "#Amy >>>" to mName+" >>> that way it changes if we change the name.

Inumedia:
Worked on setting up Registered / Deregistered + The sub commands.
Working on setting this up to be able to run straight from my iPod with a single script on my iPod's side.  Will get back to you on it :D <3
